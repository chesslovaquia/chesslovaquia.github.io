# To do list

Game navigation.

---

User preferences.

---

Fix service worker caching to use CDN as the real requests would be done later.

---

Game setup: user should choose time specs and click start.

---

Clock granularity: manage miliseconds (?) or maybe just a decimal part. Instead
of seconds as currently is.
